 * 1. The parent and child types must be different parent-child relationships
 * cannot be established between documents of the same type.
 * <p/>
 * 2. The _parent.type setting can only point to a type that doesn't exist yet.
 * This means that a type cannot become a parent type after it has been created.
 * <p/>
 * 3. Parent and child documents must be indexed on the same shard.
 * The parent ID is used as the routing value for the child, to ensure that the child is indexed on the same shard as the parent.
 * This means that the same parent value needs to be provided when getting, deleting, or updating a child document.

     * field may be attempt rebuilt within a single refresh interval when many writes are occurring.
